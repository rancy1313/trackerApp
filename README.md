# Intro
This is my second project. The goal is to make a diary type app 
that user's can make posts and interact with friends.
# Login/Sign up
It is necessary for users to make an account in order to make 
posts and add friends. There is basic information asked when a
user is signing up(name, middle name, last name, gender, and birthday). That information is displayed on their profile 
and can be edited whenever. However, the email, username, and password
are currently permanent when the account is created. Users can also have 
their own bio if they wish to add any more info about themselves.
# Posts
All users can create posts that can include a title, text, and images to their
posts. Furthermore, they can also tag any of their friends to
the post and choose who gets to view their post in the post
privacy setting(options: ['Only You', 'Friends Only', 'Everyone']). Lastly,
users can also choose what color they want their posts to be.
I added this feature for users to style their posts. Posts are displayed in
the user's home page in order from newest to oldest, and they have the date
and time they were created displayed.
# Friends
Users can send friend requests to any other user. If the user 
receiving the friend request accepts it, then both users will
become friends. Only one friend request can be sent at a time, and
if that request is rejected, then they can send another one.
Users can also view their friends home page and all of that friends
posts that are not private will show. The user can view their friend's
friends and posts their friend have been tagged in.
Users can remove anyone from their friends list by going to their page
and clicking the remove friend button. Also, users can make friend
creation accounts for anyone or anything, and tag that account in
their posts. I added this feature for users to sort their posts by
friends who do not have an account. 
# Filter Posts
Users can filter their own posts or friend's posts by either a
keyword or tagged friends. The keyword search will look through 
the post's text for the keyword and return all the posts with the
keyword in it(the keyword will be bolded in the text). The tagged friend
search will just return the posts were the friend is tagged in it.
# To do list
- optimize code
- add a share feature for users to share others posts
- make search a little more complex(multiple friend search). Currently, 
can only search by one friend at a time.
- add reactions to post
- ability to update username, password, and email
- feature to block other users
- add categories to posts
- search posts by color???
- feature to let user know if a friend's birthday is soon
